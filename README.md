**AIVIVE** is a novel **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** framework that combines a **GAN-based translator** with local optimizers. It uses biologically meaningful **gene clusters (modules)** to facilitate the demonstration of ***in vitro-in vivo*** **extrapolation (IVIVE)**.

## Introduction

This repository contains code files and models for training the AIVIVE framework and generating predictions for *in vitro-in vivo* extrapolation. Additionally, it provides scripts for applying the model to biologically relevant tasks, such as analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs), predicting necrosis, and other related applications.

## Code Scripts

### **[Preprocessing](./preprocessing)**

This folder contains the code and scripts for data preprocessing, specifically focusing on **RMA (Robust Multi-array Average) normalization** and **annotation** of gene expression data. These preprocessing steps are critical for preparing data before training the **AIVIVE** model.

**Files**:
- [`rma_vivo_single.R`](./preprocessing/rma_vivo_single.R) - R script that performs **RMA normalization** on the raw gene expression data which is widely used for processing microarray data
- [`rat_annotation.R`](./preprocessing/rat_annotation.R) - R script processes rat gene expression data by extracting probe IDs and merging them with gene annotations (relevant gene identifiers) to generate a final dataset of unique rat genes used for AIVIVE model development.

These preprocessing steps ensure that the gene expression data is properly prepared for the downstream tasks of training the **AIVIVE** model.

  - **GAN-Based Translator** framework for translating *in-vitro* transcriptomic profiles to *in-vivo* transcriptomic profiles.
  - **Local optimizers** for enhancing the model's performance.
  - **Predictions** for generating the test set predictions.

### **[Model Evaluation](./applications)**

This contains the scripts for performing AIVIVE model evaluation on the test set using three metrices: cosine similarity, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 

  - **Negative Control** -  Measurements were calculated between any two real *in vivo* profiles (excluding biological replicates), serving as a baseline for comparison. 
  - **AIVIVE** - Measurements were calculated between the optimized synthetic *in vivo* profiles generated by the model and its corresponding real profiles.
  - **Positive Control** - Measurements were calculated between biological replicates within a treatment, providing a benchmark for real biological performance. 

- **Files**:
  - [`negative_control.py`](./applications/negative_control.py) - Python script for calculating the metrices for the negative control group as defined above.
  - [`cosine.py`](./applications/cosine.py) - For calculating the cosine similarity for AIVIVE group (generated profiles).

### **[DEG Analysis](./degs)**

This folder contains the code and scripts related to **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG)** analysis for both real and AIVIVE-generated synthetic profiles. The code is the same for both rat S1500+ and modules gene sets with different input files depending on the task.

  - **Foldchange Calculation**:  The Foldchange Calculation is the difference of gene expression between treatment and control condition. It is calulcated as: ***Fold Change = Treatment Expression - Control Expression***

  - **DEG Identification**: DEGs were defined as genes with an absolute fold change > 1 in both real and synthetic profiles. It is given by: ***DEG = |FoldChange| > 1***.
    
  - **DEG Overlap Calculation**: Measures the overlap between real and generated DEGs by comparing the intersection of both sets and normalizing by the total number of real DEGs.
It is calculated as: ***Overlap = (DEGs_real ∩ DEGs_generated) / DEGs_real***

**Files**:
- [`real_fold.py`](./degs/real_fold.py) - Foldchange calculation script for real profiles.
- [`gen_fold.py`](./degs/gen_fold.py) - Foldchange calculation script for generated profiles (to be used for both rat S1500+ and module genes with modifications in input).
- [`real_deg.py`](./degs/real_deg.py) - DEG identification script for real profiles.
- [`gen_union.py`](./degs/gen_union.py) - DEG identification script for generated profiles. For synthetic profiles, an additional step was taken to calculate the union of DEGs across the subgroups of a specific treatment group.  
- [`overlap_deg.py`](./degs/overlap_deg.py) - DEGs overlap calculation script.

This contains code for performing **AOP (Adverse Outcome Pathway)** analysis combined with **Gene Expression Analysis**. The goal is to investigate the percentage error in gene expression values between real and AIVIVE-generated synthetic test profiles for AOP-related genes.

  - **Percentage Error in Gene Expression**: The AOP genes were identified from the rat S1500+ gene set and percentage error was calulcated for the gene expression values between the real and AIVIVE-generated synthetic profiles.
